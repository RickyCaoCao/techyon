# Cloning the repository locally

When you first create the `<username>.github.io` repository, you'll get a link
to the repository in the Quick Setup section. 

If you can't find the link, you can take the repository's URL and add `.git` to the end.

Here are the steps to clone your repository through the link. 
```bash
$ cd SOME_PATH_TO_STORE_REPO

// Clone your Github repository named <username>.github.io
$ git clone https://github.com/andytechyon/andytechyon.github.io.git

// If you have SSH set up with your Github account
$ git clone git@github.com:andytechyon/andytechyon.github.io.git
```
