# If HTML and CSS could build a house

What if HTML and CSS could build a house? This is how we'd define the HTML of a house.
```html
<house>
  <kitchen>
    <oven></oven>
  </kitchen>
  <bedroom>
  </bedroom>
</house>
```

This is how we'd define the CSS for a house.
```css
house {
  width: 100ft;
  length: 100ft;
  height: 30ft;
  color: red;
  driveway: none;
}
```
